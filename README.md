## Sat Oct 18:
training params:
- NUM_EPOCHS = 5
- BATCH_SIZE = 64
- LEARNING_RATE = 0.001

model params:
- num_conv_layers=3,
- initial_channels=8,
- channel_multiplier=2.0,
- num_classes=10

Got test accuracy of 98.84% after 5 epochs. 

From here we can hypertune:
1. Model params
2. Training params
3. Optimizer choice
4. Data augmentation techniques
